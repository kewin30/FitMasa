# Fitmasa
This project, Fitmasa, is similar to a popular application called Fitatu.
The main idea behind both is to enable users to count their calories, search for food products, and track other nutrients.
Additionally, it also allows users to calculate their BMR and BMI, and upload before and after photos of their diet.
I used an API from the internet to access a large database of food information.
The biggest challenge I faced during the development of this project was passing data from the search page to the home page without the data disappearing when switching between forms.

I used Newtonsoft.json package to handle the json data which came from the api, and json to C# class converter, because I had to have a structure of classes.
